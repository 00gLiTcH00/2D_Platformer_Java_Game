# 2D_Platformer_Java_Game
- This is an university project. I chose to make a platformer using JAVA language.
- The controls are the same as any other platformer game:
A,D - movement |
SPACE - jump |
LEFT CLICK - light attack |
RIGHT CLICK - heavy attack |
ESC - pause |

- The goal of the game is to kill all enemies.
- The options button does not work :)
